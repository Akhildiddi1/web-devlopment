                The ISH Student Council (STUCO) operates in the secondary school and provides a voice for the students and gives them meaningful leadership opportunities. The student council suggests improvements, helps ensure that students make responsible decisions and helps organize social and fundraising events. The Student Council consists of a President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Class representative. Students from Secondary School and grade 5 elect the members of the student council at the start of each calendar year.
